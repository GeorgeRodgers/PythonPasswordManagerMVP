Creating a password manager in Python for multiple users, where data is stored in files, is an interesting project. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you build a simple password manager with the following features:

1. **Multiple Users**: Each user will have their own set of passwords.
2. **Storing Data in Files**: Instead of using a database, we'll store each user's passwords in separate files.
3. **Encryption**: To keep the passwords secure, you should encrypt the passwords using a library like `cryptography`.

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- `cryptography` library for encryption. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install cryptography
  ```

---

### Step 1: Define the Structure of the Password Manager

For simplicity, we will create a structure where:
- Each user has their own file that contains encrypted passwords.
- The passwords will be stored in a dictionary-like format (key-value pairs) where the key is the website or service name, and the value is the password.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Basic Encryption Functions

First, we need a way to encrypt and decrypt the passwords. We'll use the `cryptography` library to achieve this. We'll generate a key for each user to encrypt and decrypt their passwords.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

def generate_key():
    """Generate a new key for the user."""
    return Fernet.generate_key()

def save_key(username, key):
    """Save the generated key to a file named after the user."""
    key_path = f'{username}_key.key'
    with open(key_path, 'wb') as key_file:
        key_file.write(key)

def load_key(username):
    """Load the user's key from file."""
    key_path = f'{username}_key.key'
    if os.path.exists(key_path):
        with open(key_path, 'rb') as key_file:
            return key_file.read()
    else:
        return None

def encrypt_data(key, data):
    """Encrypt the given data using the provided key."""
    f = Fernet(key)
    encrypted_data = f.encrypt(data.encode())
    return encrypted_data

def decrypt_data(key, encrypted_data):
    """Decrypt the given data using the provided key."""
    f = Fernet(key)
    decrypted_data = f.decrypt(encrypted_data)
    return decrypted_data.decode()
```

---

### Step 3: Create Functions to Manage User and Passwords

Next, we need functions for user login, password storage, and retrieval. We'll also implement a function to store passwords in a file.

```python
import json

def create_user(username):
    """Create a new user with their own password file and encryption key."""
    # Check if the user already exists
    if os.path.exists(f"{username}_passwords.json"):
        print(f"User {username} already exists.")
        return False

    # Generate a new encryption key
    key = generate_key()

    # Save the encryption key for the user
    save_key(username, key)

    # Create a new empty password file
    with open(f"{username}_passwords.json", 'w') as file:
        json.dump({}, file)

    print(f"User {username} created successfully.")
    return True

def load_passwords(username):
    """Load encrypted passwords from a user's file."""
    try:
        with open(f"{username}_passwords.json", 'r') as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"User {username} does not exist.")
        return None

def save_passwords(username, passwords):
    """Save the encrypted passwords to the user's password file."""
    with open(f"{username}_passwords.json", 'w') as file:
        json.dump(passwords, file)

def add_password(username, service, password):
    """Add a password for a service under the user's account."""
    key = load_key(username)
    if not key:
        print("No encryption key found for this user.")
        return

    # Encrypt the password
    encrypted_password = encrypt_data(key, password)

    # Load current passwords
    passwords = load_passwords(username)

    if passwords is None:
        return

    # Add the encrypted password for the service
    passwords[service] = encrypted_password

    # Save updated passwords
    save_passwords(username, passwords)

    print(f"Password for {service} added successfully.")

def retrieve_password(username, service):
    """Retrieve and decrypt the password for a service under the user's account."""
    key = load_key(username)
    if not key:
        print("No encryption key found for this user.")
        return

    # Load passwords
    passwords = load_passwords(username)

    if passwords is None:
        return

    # Retrieve the encrypted password
    if service in passwords:
        encrypted_password = passwords[service]
        decrypted_password = decrypt_data(key, encrypted_password)
        print(f"Password for {service}: {decrypted_password}")
    else:
        print(f"No password found for {service}.")
```

---

### Step 4: User Interface for the Password Manager

Finally, we can implement a simple interface to interact with the password manager. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) where the user can log in, add passwords, and retrieve them.

```python
def main():
    print("Welcome to the Password Manager")
    while True:
        print("\nOptions:")
        print("1. Create a new user")
        print("2. Login")
        print("3. Exit")

        choice = input("Select an option (1/2/3): ")

        if choice == '1':
            username = input("Enter username to create: ")
            create_user(username)

        elif choice == '2':
            username = input("Enter username: ")
            password = input("Enter password: ")

            # For simplicity, we will skip actual password authentication
            # In a real application, you would authenticate users.
            print(f"Welcome {username}!")
            while True:
                print("\n1. Add a password")
                print("2. Retrieve a password")
                print("3. Logout")

                sub_choice = input("Select an option (1/2/3): ")

                if sub_choice == '1':
                    service = input("Enter the service (e.g., Google, Facebook): ")
                    password = input("Enter the password: ")
                    add_password(username, service, password)

                elif sub_choice == '2':
                    service = input("Enter the service (e.g., Google, Facebook): ")
                    retrieve_password(username, service)

                elif sub_choice == '3':
                    print("Logging out...")
                    break

        elif choice == '3':
            print("Exiting...")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Step 5: Explanation of the Code

1. **Encryption and Decryption**: We use the `cryptography.fernet` module to securely encrypt and decrypt passwords. The encryption key is saved separately for each user.
   
2. **User Management**:
   - The `create_user` function creates a new user and generates an encryption key for them.
   - Passwords are stored in a JSON file (`username_passwords.json`) that contains encrypted password entries.
   - Each password is encrypted before being saved and decrypted when retrieved.

3. **Password Management**:
   - You can add a password for a service using `add_password`.
   - You can retrieve a password for a service using `retrieve_password`.

4. **File Structure**:
   - For each user, two files are created:
     - A key file (`username_key.key`) to store the encryption key.
     - A password file (`username_passwords.json`) to store the encrypted passwords.

### Step 6: Run the Application

You can run the password manager by executing the script. Here's what the interaction might look like:

```bash
Welcome to the Password Manager

Options:
1. Create a new user
2. Login
3. Exit
Select an option (1/2/3): 1
Enter username to create: john_doe
User john_doe created successfully.

Options:
1. Create a new user
2. Login
3. Exit
Select an option (1/2/3): 2
Enter username: john_doe
Enter password: 
Welcome john_doe!

1. Add a password
2. Retrieve a password
3. Logout
Select an option (1/2/3): 1
Enter the service (e.g., Google, Facebook): Google
Enter the password: mysecretpassword
Password for Google added successfully.

1. Add a password
2. Retrieve a password
3. Logout
Select an option (1/2/3): 2
Enter the service (e.g., Google, Facebook): Google
Password for Google: mysecretpassword
```

### Conclusion

This simple Python-based password manager allows for multiple users and stores passwords in files, using encryption to protect them. You can extend this by adding more features like password validation, stronger authentication, or support for more advanced user interactions.
